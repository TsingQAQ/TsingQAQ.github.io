      "abstract": "Machine learning has promised to change the landscape of laboratory chemistry, with impressive results in molecular property prediction and reaction retro-synthesis. However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.",

      "abstract": "Graph Bayesian optimization (BO) has shown potential as a powerful and data-efficient tool for neural architecture search (NAS). Most existing graph BO works focus on developing graph surrogates models, i.e., metrics of networks and/or different kernels to quantify the similarity between networks. However, the acquisition optimization, as a discrete optimization task over graph structures, is not well studied due to the complexity of formulating the graph search space and acquisition functions. This paper presents explicit optimization formulations for graph input space including properties such as reachability and shortest paths, which are used later to formulate graph kernels and the acquisition function. We theoretically prove that the proposed encoding is an equivalent representation of the graph space and provide restrictions for the NAS domain with either node or edge labels. Numerical results over several NAS benchmarks show that our method efficiently finds the optimal architecture for most cases, highlighting its efficacy.",

To identify the optimal conditions in limited trials, we introduce a few-shot Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework based on the system's prior information. At the core of our approach is the System-Aware Neural ODE Processes (SANODEP), an extension of Neural ODE Processes (NODEP) designed to meta-learn ODE systems from multiple trajectories using a novel context embedding block. We further develop a two-stage BO framework to effectively incorporate search space constraints, enabling efficient optimization of both initial conditions and observation timings. We conduct extensive experiments showcasing SANODEP's potential for few-shot BO within dynamical systems. We also explore SANODEP's adaptability to varying levels of prior information, highlighting the trade-off between prior flexibility and model fitting accuracy.",

Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for optimizing black-box functions, and existing technologies can be applied to optimize functions over nodes of a single fixed graph.

Estimating the entire Pareto front can be computationally expensive, and is not always necessary, as decision makers will likely be interested only in specific regions of the Pareto front. In the absence of knowledge about the decision maker preferences, the so-called knees in the Pareto front are considered to be particularly attractive. In this paper, we propose using Thompson Sampling in the Bayesian optimization framework to estimate the location of the knee regions in a data-efficient manner. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods accurately locate the knee regions after a very small number of evaluations, providing a computationally efficient approach to single-and multi-knee detection in multi-objective optimization.",

An example of an attractive solution is the knee point of the Pareto front, although the current literature differs on the definition of a knee. In this work, we propose to detect knee solutions in a data-efficient manner (i.e., with a limited number of time-consuming evaluations), according to two definitions of knees.

In this paper, we propose a Spectral Representation of Robustness Measures based on the GPâ€™s spectral representation, ie, an analytical approach to approximately infer both robustness measures for normal and uniform input uncertainty distributions. We present two approximations based on different Fourier features and compare their accuracy numerically.

      "abstract": "Identifying all designs satisfying a set of constraints is an important part of the engineering design process. With physics-based simulation codes, evaluating the constraints becomes considerable expensive. Active learning can provide an elegant approach to efficiently characterize the feasible region, i.e., the set of feasible designs. Although active learning strategies have been proposed for this task, most of them are dealing with adding just one sample per iteration as opposed to selecting multiple samples per iteration, also known as batch active learning. While this is efficient with respect to the amount of information gained per iteration, it neglects available computation resources. We propose a batch Bayesian active learning technique for feasible region identification by assuming that the constraint function is Lipschitz continuous. In addition, we extend current state-of-the-art batch methods to also handle â€¦",

However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.",

Most existing graph BO works focus on developing graph surrogates models, i.e., metrics of networks and/or different kernels to quantify the similarity between networks. However, the acquisition optimization, as a discrete optimization task over graph structures, is not well studied due to the complexity of formulating the graph search space and acquisition functions. This paper presents explicit optimization formulations for graph input space including properties such as reachability and shortest paths, which are used later to formulate graph kernels and the acquisition function. We theoretically prove that the proposed encoding is an equivalent representation of the graph space and provide restrictions for the NAS domain with either node or edge labels. Numerical results over several NAS benchmarks show that our method efficiently finds the optimal architecture for most cases, highlighting its efficacy.",

To identify the optimal conditions in limited trials, we introduce a few-shot Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework based on the system's prior information. At the core of our approach is the System-Aware Neural ODE Processes (SANODEP), an extension of Neural ODE Processes (NODEP) designed to meta-learn ODE systems from multiple trajectories using a novel context embedding block. We further develop a two-stage BO framework to effectively incorporate search space constraints, enabling efficient optimization of both initial conditions and observation timings. We conduct extensive experiments showcasing SANODEP's potential for few-shot BO within dynamical systems.

          "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization requires many evaluations to identify a sufficiently dense approximation of the Pareto front. Especially for a higher number of objectives, extracting the Pareto front might not be easy nor cheap. On the other hand, the Decision-Maker is not always interested in the entire Pareto front, and might prefer a solution where there is a desirable trade-off between different objectives. An example of an attractive solution is the knee point of the Pareto front, although the current literature differs on the definition of a knee. In this work, we propose to detect knee solutions in a data-efficient manner (i.e., with a limited number of time-consuming evaluations), according to two definitions of knees. In particular, we propose several novel acquisition functions in the Bayesian Optimization framework for detecting these knees, which allows for scaling to many objectives. The suggested acquisition functions are â€¦",

In reality, these requirements can be often considered as constraints of the design problem, that can be defined in terms of performance measures or geometrical characteristics of the device under study. In this paper, a new design space exploration methodology is presented for discovering feasible regions in the design space, where the term feasible region indicates the set of all design configurations satisfying all constraints of the design problem. The proposed method is based on Gaussian process metamodels to estimate the feasible region and leverages a information-based adaptive sampling technique to sequentially refine the prediction accuracy, which is applicable for multiple constraints problems.

          "abstract": "In modern electronics, there are many inevitable uncertainties and variations of design parameters that have a profound effect on the performance of a device. These are, among others, induced by manufacturing tolerances, assembling inaccuracies, material diversities, machining errors, etc. This prompts wide interests in enhanced optimization algorithms that take the effect of these uncertainty sources into account and that are able to find robust designs, i.e., designs that are insensitive to the uncertainties early in the design cycle. In this work, a novel machine learning-based optimization framework that accounts for uncertainty of the design parameters is presented. This is achieved by using a modified version of the expected improvement criterion. Moreover, a data-efficient Bayesian Optimization framework is leveraged to limit the number of simulations required to find a robust design solution. Two suitable application examples validate that the robustness is significantly improved compared to standard design methods.",

These measures are widely used in applications where the robustness of the solution is of interest, for example, in engineering design. While the variance is commonly used to characterize the robustness, Bayesian inference of the variance using GPs is known to be challenging. In this paper, we propose a Spectral Representation of Robustness Measures based on the GPâ€™s spectral representation, ie, an analytical approach to approximately infer both robustness measures for normal and uniform input uncertainty distributions. We present two approximations based on different Fourier features and compare their accuracy numerically. To demonstrate their utility and efficacy in robust Bayesian Optimization, we integrate the analytical robustness measures in three standard acquisition functions for various robust optimization formulations. We show their competitive performance on numerical benchmarks and real-life applications.",

If the weight penalty is taken into account, will the ducted propeller still be superior to an open propeller? And in this scenario, how will a ducted propeller with better efficiency than an open propeller be designed? This paper investigates these questions by parametric analysis based on experiments and then parametric optimization that involves hovering efficiency and structural weight in objective functions. Both multi-disciplinary design optimization and multi-objective programming are performed by surrogate-based optimization. An in-house automatic structured mesh generation module is developed to deal with significant geometry variation in design space.

With physics-based simulation codes, evaluating the constraints becomes considerable expensive. Active learning can provide an elegant approach to efficiently characterize the feasible region, i.e., the set of feasible designs. Although active learning strategies have been proposed for this task, most of them are dealing with adding just one sample per iteration as opposed to selecting multiple samples per iteration, also known as batch active learning. While this is efficient with respect to the amount of information gained per iteration, it neglects available computation resources. We propose a batch Bayesian active learning technique for feasible region identification by assuming that the constraint function is Lipschitz continuous.
