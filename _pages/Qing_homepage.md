I am a PhD candidate at [SUMO lab](http://sumo.intec.ugent.be/), [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en), under the supervision and guidance of Professor [Tom Dhaene](http://sumo.intec.ugent.be/tdhaene) and Professor [Ivo Couckuyt](http://sumo.intec.ugent.be/icouckuy) for Data efficient machine learning techinique. My research mainly focus on [Bayesian optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization#:~:text=Bayesian%20optimization%20is%20a%20sequential,expensive%2Dto%2Devaluate%20functions.), [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)) and applied machine learning.

My master was finished about flight vehicle design in school of aeronautics at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), under the supervision and guidance of Professor Hu Yu. As a member of the lab which made the first successful flight of double ducted fan in China, my researches primarily involve optimization algorithms and their applications on [ducted fan VTOL aircrafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducted_fan). For instance, improving ducted fan aircraft's performance through high fidelity computational methods ([Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics)) and efficient global optimizations ([Kriging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging)/[Gaussian Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process#:~:text=In%20probability%20theory%20and%20statistics,of%20them%20is%20normally%20distributed.) based sequential design method).
