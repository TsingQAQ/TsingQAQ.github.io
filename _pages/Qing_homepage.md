I am a PhD candidate at [SUMO lab](http://sumo.intec.ugent.be/), [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en), under the supervision and guidance of Professor [Tom Dhaene](http://sumo.intec.ugent.be/tdhaene) and Dr [Ivo Couckuyt](http://sumo.intec.ugent.be/icouckuy) for Data efficient machine learning techinique. My research mainly focus on Bayesian optimization, active learning and generative design.

My master was finished about flight vehicle design in school of aeronautics at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), under the supervision and guidance of Professor Hu Yu. As a member of the lab which made the first successful flight of double ducted fan in China, my researches primarily involve optimization algorithms and their applications on [ducted fan VTOL aircrafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducted_fan). For instance, improving ducted fan aircrafts' performance through high fidelity computational methods (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and efficient global optimizations ([Kriging/Gaussian Process Regression ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging) based sequential design method).
