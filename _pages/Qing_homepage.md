Biography
======
I am a second year postgraduate student major in flight vehible design in school of aeronautics at Northwestern Polytechnical University, under the Supervision and guidance of Professor Hu Yu.


Being a lab member of which [made the first successful flight of double ducted fan in China](http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/n1146445/c5637908/content.html). My research primarily involve optimization algorithms and its applications on [ducted fan VTOL aircrafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducted_fan). For instance, improving ducted fan aircrafts performance through high fidelity computational methods (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and efficient global optimizations ([Kriging/Gaussian Process Regression ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging) based sequential design method, while the former one is more frequently used in aeronautics).  I also have some experience in design and optimization of fixed wing aircrafts.

I will apply for PhD for fall semester of 2019 and I am interested in optimization algorithms and design & optimization related programs.  My information is attached in the [CV page](https://tsingqaq.github.io/cv/). And some projects I've participated are also provided [here](https://tsingqaq.github.io/projects/). If you're interested for more details, don’t hesitate to contact me.
